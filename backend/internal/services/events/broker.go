// Package events implements an in-process pub/sub broker used to push
// real-time inbox updates from LINE webhook handlers + admin actions to
// SSE-connected admin clients (browsers).
//
// Why in-process: BillFlow runs as a single Go container (one process per
// deployment). All subscribers share the same memory; a sync.Map of channels
// is enough — no Redis/NATS needed. If the deployment ever scales to
// multiple replicas, swap this for a Redis-backed broker (interface stays
// the same).
//
// Why not WebSocket: SSE is one-way (server → client) which is exactly what
// the inbox needs — admin sends via existing POST endpoints. EventSource has
// auto-reconnect built into every browser, so the frontend stays simple.
